# 30 Days of Vanilla JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to my **30 Days JavaScript** journey!  
This repository contains **all 30 mini-projects** I built while following Wes Bos's famous [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course — using **only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no React, no frameworks, no build tools).

Goal: Strengthen core JavaScript skills (DOM manipulation, events, arrays, async, fetch, canvas, audio, geolocation, speech recognition, and more) by building something cool every day.

### What's inside?

- 30 fully functional, responsive web mini-apps
- Clean, well-commented code in each folder
- Live demo links (if hosted) or easy local run instructions
- Screenshots / GIFs of each project (optional – add them!)
